Hello, this is a project dedicated to restoring some of the megamix's tilesets. I have included the image files and some gmx background files with them. 

IMPORTANT: The tilesets have been rerranged from original so i advise you if you had the old tileset in a level you working on, don't replace it.

Intrsuctions on how to replace:

1. Go to gm, right click on a bg, and select properties. Then you'll need to select load background and get the replacement bg.

2. Now that has been done, some have additional animation bgs so right click bg and select duplicate. Then rename to appropriate setting and do the same as before when you replace bg.

3.Optionally, you have a choice to insert a gm background file. To do so, Right click at bg and select add exsisting bg. You must find that bg of your choice and there you go!


There are also animation codes you can use for more accurate animations! Simply copy and paste the code into a tileset animator, change layers and done!


All tilesets are not made by me! Copyright goes to Capcom. Feel free to use the restored tilesets for whatever use. No perms needed.
